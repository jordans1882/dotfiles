While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, itâ€™s also smart enough to recognize mistakes that native speakers commonly make and it will improve your writing overall. This grammar and spelling correction works across all variations of common language; distinguishing between U.S. and British English, for instance. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use but that are not found in a conventional dictionary. LanguageTool will recognize these words in future grammar checking and proofreading."
